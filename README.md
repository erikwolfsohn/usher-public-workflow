# usher-public-workflow
A Dockstore WDL Workflow that uses UShER to place your consensus.fasta sequences on the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny

## Introduction
[UShER](https://github.com/yatisht/usher) (Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing Trees) uses maximum parsimony to rapidly place new samples onto an existing phylogenetic tree (1).  We have built a workflow that lets Public Health Labs with SARS-CoV-2 consensus fasta sequence files easily identify the viral genomic sequences in public databases that are most similar.
